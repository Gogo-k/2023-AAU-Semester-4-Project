WELCOME TO THE SPARK COMPILER

This project is made consists of a compiler written in Java made for a 4th-semester project at Aalborg University Copenhagen

HOW TO RUN THE COMPILER

1. Place the file which is to be compiled in the "Input" folder, this folder can be found through the path \P4\Input

2. Currently the compiler can only compile the file if it is a ".txt" file with the name "code", so be sure this is the case

3. Run the file "Run.java" which can be found in the path \P4\src\Main

4. If there occurs no errors, the result of the compiled input file can be found in the "Output" folder with the name "JavaFile.java", this folder can be found in the path \P4\Output
